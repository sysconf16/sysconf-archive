<h3>
📏 Thin & Lights
</h3>

<ul>
<li>Great for most individuals and a variety of use cases, including school, office work and general internet browsing or email.</li>
<li>Prioritise portability with a small form factor and long battery life.</li>
<li>May lack I/O options and expandibility.</li>
<li>Variable build quality depending on model and manufacturer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
💼 Business
</h3>

<ul>
<li>Great for most individuals and a variety of use cases, including school, office work and general internet browsing or email.</li>
<li>Prioritise connectivity, often with ample I/O options and expandibility.</li>
<li>Known for superior build quality and extended longevity.</li>
<li>May lack premium features on lower-end tiers, e.g. small form factor, high resolution or colour accurate screens and long battery life.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
🎮 Gaming
</h3>

<ul>
<li>Useful for those requiring better graphical capabilities than integrated graphics options can offer, e.g. for gaming, 3D modelling, design or video editing and effects.</li>
<li>Prioritise connectivity, often with ample I/O options and expandibility.</li>
<li>Known for being large and heavy with sub-par battery life.</li>
<li>Run hotter and slower than a desktop with equivalent specifications.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<center>
<p>
In cases where better graphical performance is required, a desktop PC is highly recommended due to better price/performance.

<h3>
💲 Budget Tier 
</h3>

<p>
£200 - £350 | Intel Core i5 8250U/8350U/8265U machines
</p>

<ul>
<li>Good CPU performance for the price. <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i5-8250U+%40+1.60GHz&id=3042">PassMark for an 8250U.</a></li>
<li>Undervolt very well for additional performance and battery life.</li>
<li>Will need to be found used on eBay. Condition and battery health may therefore vary.</li>
<li>Finding a machine with a minimum of 8GB RAM, an SSD and a 1080p resolution screen is recommended as expandibility on consumer devices may be limited. May be less of a problem on business class machines.</li>
</ul>

<p>
£300 - £350 | AMD Ryzen 3 4300U machines
</p>

<ul>
<li>Superior single-core and multi-core performance in comparison to an 8250U due to architectural improvements in Zen 2 versus Kaby Lake Refresh. <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=AMD+Ryzen+3+4300U&id=3664">PassMark.</a></li>
<li>Scarce availability due to limited production.</li>
<li>Can be found used on websites such as eBay for a reduced price. Condition and battery health may vary however.</li>
<li>Most devices lack expandibility and can only be found with 4GB of soldered RAM.</li>
<li>Should only be considered if found with a minimum of 8GB RAM, an SSD and a 1080p resolution screen, unless upgradibility is confirmed. May be less of a problem on business class machines.</li>
</ul>

📝 Notes
</h2>

<p>
<strong>Intel Core iX 10th and 11th Generation U-Series based machines are NOT recommended because:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/AMD-Ryzen-5-4600U-vs-Intel-i5-10210U-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-4800U-vs-Intel-i7-10510U/3725vs3542vs3721vs3549">Worse single-core and multi-core performance in comparison to their AMD counterparts.</a></li>
<li>Cannot be undervolted due to <a href="https://plundervolt.com/">Plundervolt</a> vulnerability patches after Q2 2020. This makes battery life and thermals worse than their AMD counterparts.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>AMD Ryzen 5 5600H based machines have not been included because of:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Similar pricing to 5800H based machines.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/AMD-Ryzen-5-5600H-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-5800H/4274vs3907">Inferior performance in comparison to a 5800H.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
*16GB and 32GB DDR4 3200MHz SO-DIMM memory kits are largely unavailable new from retailers, but new or slightly used kits can often be found on eBay for auction.
