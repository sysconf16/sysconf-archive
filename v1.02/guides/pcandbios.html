<h2>
🔧 The Build
</h2>

<h3>
0️⃣ Prerequisites
</h3>
<ol>
<li>Collect your parts and lay them on a large surface, e.g. a table.</li>
<li>Ground yourself by touching a large, metal object around your house, e.g. a radiator.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
1️⃣ Motherboard Preperation
</h3>
<ol>
<li>Open the motherboard box and remove the motherboard from its anti-static bag.</li>
<li>Close the motherboard box and place the motherboard on top.</li>
<li>Open the CPU box and remove the CPU tray.</li>
<li>Open the CPU socket by lifting the lever up and to the opposite side until you hear a click if AMD, or pull the latch down and out then lift the lid upwards if Intel.</li>
<li>Open the CPU tray and remove the CPU, holding it by the edges to not touch the pads or pins on the underside.</li>
<li>Insert the CPU into the socket by aligning the arrow on the socket with the arrow printed on the CPU.</li>
<li>Close the socket in the reverse way you opened it. There may be some resistance if installing an Intel CPU.</li>
<li>Remove the RAM from its packaging.</li>
<li>Refer to the motherboard's manual to choose the correct slots to insert the DIMMs into for dual channel memory mode if two DIMMS are being used.</li>
<li>Open the latches on the sides of the DIMM slots on the motherboard.</li>
<li>Align the notch in the centre of the DIMM with the notch in the centre of the slot in the motherboard.</li>
<li>Insert each stick one by one, pushing firmly on the edges of the stick to seat it within the slot.</li>
<li>If installing an M.2 drive, remove it from the packaging.</li>
<li>Refer to the motherboard's manual to choose the correct M.2 slot to install the drive to ensure correct compatibility, e.g. if a PCIe Gen 4 drive is being used, ensure that the drive is being installed into a PCIe Gen 4 compliant M.2 slot.</li>
<li>Unscrew the M.2 screw from the stand-off or if not pre-installed, find the M.2 screw in the motherboard box.</li>
<li>Slide the pins of the M.2 drive into the slot with the label facing outwards.</li>
<li>If the screw hole of the M.2 drive does not align with the stand-off, remove the drive and move the stand-off to a different hole on the board.</li>
<li>Screw the M.2 drive into the slot.</li>
<li>If using a stock or aftermarket air cooler, remove the cooler from its packaging.</li>
<li>If using a water cooler, leave it in the packaging until later.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions provided with the cooler to ensure proper installation. Each cooler will differ in installation technique.</li>
<li>If applying thermal paste, remove the syringe cap and push a pea sized blob out onto the centre of the CPU.</li>
<li>The motherboard should now be prepared with CPU, RAM, SSD and cooler installed.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
2️⃣️ Case Preperation
</h3>
<ol>
<li>Remove the case from its packaging.</li>
<li>Unscrew and remove both side-panels by unscrewing the thumb-screws on the front or rear of the side-panel depending on case model.
<li>Remove the front-panel from the case if additional fans are going to be installed.</li>
<li>Remove the accessory box from the case.</li>
<li>Remove any additional fans from their packaging and screw them into the case using the included self-tapping screws.</li>
<li>Lay the case on its side.</li>
<li>If the motherboard does not have a pre-installed I/O shield, re-open the motherboard box and remove the I/O shield.</li>
<li>Remove the I/O shield from its packet and install it in the correct orientation at the rear of the case.</li>
<li>The case is now ready for the motherboard to be mounted.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
3️⃣️ Motherboard Mounting
</h3>
<ol>
<li>Test-fit the motherboard into the case to ensure that all of the pre-installed motherboard stand-offs in the case align with the screw holes on the motherboard.</li>
<li>If the test-fit is not successful, use pliers to remove the misplaced stand-offs and place them into the correct locations on the motherboard tray.</li>
<li>Re-fit the motherboard into the case ensuring that the rear I/O aligns with the I/O shield.</li>
<li>Open the case's accessories box and remove the screw packet</li>
<li>Open the screw packet and pour the screws onto a bowl or plate</li>
<li>Use the curved circular screws to screw the motherboard into the motherboard tray.</li>
<li>If using a water cooler, remove it from its packaging.</li>
<li>Mount the radiator to the case. It is recommended to install this at the top if possible. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbGomv195sk">Gamers Nexus</a></li>

</ol>

<h3>
4️⃣ Drives, Expansion Cards & Power Supply
</h3>
<ol>
<li>Refer to the motherboard manual's front-panel connector layout and install the front-panel connectors (power switch, reset switch, power LED, disk activity LED, front-panel audio and USB) to the motherboard.</li>
<li>Open and mount any 2.5" or 3.5" drives to the drive bays using the hexagonal-shaped headed screws from the case accessory box.</li>

<li>Remove the PSU from its packaging.</li>
<li>Insert the PSU into the case and mount it, often at the rear, using the screws included.</li>
<li>Connect the 24-pin motherboard power cable from the PSU to the right side of the motherboard.</li>
<li>Connect the 8-pin CPU EPS power cable from the PSU to the top left of the motherboard.</li>
<li>If your motherboard only has a 4-pin EPS power connector, split the 8-pin from the PSU into two halves and insert the half which fits.</li>
<li>Connect the SATA power cables from the PSU to any installed 2.5" or 3.5" drives.</li>
<li>Remove any brackets covering the PCI connectors on the rear of the case.</li>
<li>If installing a discrete graphics card, remove it from its packaging.</li>
<li>If the card is single slot, remove the PCI blanking plate corresponding to the 16X slot from the rear of the case.</li>
<li>If the card is 2+ slots, remove the PCI blanking plates corresponding to the 16X slot and additional underneath from the rear of the case.</li>
<li>Remove any platic covers over the PCI-E 16X connector on the graphics card.</li>
<li>Push the GPU into the motherboard's PCI-E 16X slot.</li>
<li>Screw the graphics card into the case using the hexagonal-shaped headed screws from the case accessory box.</li>
<li>Connect any PCI-E peripheral power connectors from the PSU to the GPU if required.</li>
<li>If installing a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth card, remove it from its packaging.</li>
<li>Remove the PCI blanking plate corresponding to the PCI-E slot into which the card is to be installed on the motherboard.</li>
<li>Insert the card into the PCI-E slot of the motherboard.</li>

</ol>

<h3>
5️⃣ Finishing Touches
</h3>
<ol>
<li>Re-install any brackets covering the PCI slots on the rear of the case.</li>
<li>Using zip ties or velcro straps, tie down as many cables as possible at the rear of the motherboard tray.</li>
<li>Re-install the front and side-panels in the reverse way by which they were removed.</li>
<li>Connect a mouse, keyboard and monitor to the computer, ensuring to plug the monitor into the graphics card and not the motherboard if a discrete GPU is being used.</li>
<li>Remove the kettle lead from the PSU box and plug the motherboard into the mains.</li>
<li>Flick the switch on the back of the PSU to the on position and press the power button.</li>
<li>Wait for the PC to POST, while repeatedly pressing the BIOS key on the keyboard to enter the BIOS. This may take up to a minute on first boot. See below for the BIOS key of each motherboard manufacturer.</li>
<li>Once in the BIOS, verify that the CPU, RAM, and drives are correctly detected.</li>
<li>Shut down the PC by holding the power button.</li>

<h3>
⚙️ Making Changes in the BIOS (for Windows 11 Compatibility)
</h3>
<ol>
<li>Press the power button and enter the BIOS by repeatedly pressing the BIOS key.</li>
<li>Enable XMP.</li>
<li>Enable UEFI boot and disable legacy boot.</li>
<li>Disable PXE/network/LAN boot.</li>
<li>Enable TPM by looking for "Intel PTT" on Intel chipset motherboards or "AMD fTPM" on AMD chipset motherboards.</li>
<li>If there's an option to specify OS type, select "Windows 10 WHQL".</li>
